# Tic-tac-toe

Created using:

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript

# Learning Outcome

- Objects in JavaScript
- Minimalise global variables in code
- DOM manipulation


# The Odin Project

I created this project as part of The Odin Project Fullstack JavaScript course in order to continue to learn about Objects and DOM manipulation.
My hope is that those that view this page and my other projects as part of this course can get an idea of my programming knowledge. These projects will help to catalogue my own journey into Fullstack JavaScript development.
